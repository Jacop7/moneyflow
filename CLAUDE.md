# CLAUDE.md — moneyflow

## Project Overview

**moneyflow** is a new project in its initial stage. The repository currently contains only a README and this guide. This file should be updated as the project grows.

## Repository Structure

```
moneyflow/
├── .git/
├── CLAUDE.md       # This file — AI assistant guide
└── README.md       # Project README
```

## Development Setup

No dependencies or build system configured yet. Update this section when a language, framework, or package manager is chosen.

## Commands

_None configured yet._ Document build, test, lint, and run commands here as they are added.

<!-- Example format to follow:
```
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Production build
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Lint code
```
-->

## Architecture

_To be defined._ Document key modules, data flow, and design decisions here as the codebase takes shape.

## Code Conventions

- Keep commits small and focused with descriptive messages.
- Prefer simple, readable code over clever abstractions.
- Add tests alongside new functionality.
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or `.env` files.

## Git Workflow

- **Default branch:** `master`
- Use feature branches for development.
- Write clear commit messages that explain *why*, not just *what*.

## Key Files to Update

When the project grows, keep these files current:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI assistant context and project conventions |
| `README.md` | User-facing project documentation |

## Notes for AI Assistants

- Read this file at the start of every session for up-to-date project context.
- This is a greenfield project — confirm tech stack and design decisions with the user before making major choices.
- Update this file whenever significant structural changes are made (new frameworks, directories, commands, or conventions).
